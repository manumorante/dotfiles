# Hushlogin

Suppresses "Last login" messages in terminal.

## What it does

The `.hushlogin` file in your home directory (`~/.hushlogin`) prevents the system from showing login messages when opening a new terminal session.

## Installation

```bash
cp .hushlogin ~/.hushlogin
```

The file can be empty - its presence is what matters.
